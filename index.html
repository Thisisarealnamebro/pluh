  <h2 class="hp">About Me</h2>
  <p class="hp">Hi, my name is Aqeel Sathish! I am 14 and a year 10 student at Dubai International Academy. In my free
    time, I love watching movies and TV shows, trying new cooking recipes, playing video games, going to malls with my
    friends, and playing chess. This website was created to help new ex-pats of the UAE by informing them about the best
    communities to live in, reliable services, transport, schools, and more! Each webpage will be dedicated to one of
    the mentioned topics to give more detail.</p>
